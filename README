= Overview =

Maglica is a Python library and command-line tool for an internal cloud. 
(This tool is primitive beta now.)

This is very simple and based on libvirt, virt-clone and zeromq (for RPC).

The name "Maglica" is derived from a Bosnian word that means "Nebula."

= Architecture of Maglica =

Maglica has four components.

 1. Library
 2. CLI 
 3. Client worker
 4. Host workers

Maglica library is a main component of Maglica.Maglica CLI calls the library
to do the jobs.The library talks to libvirtd on other hosts directly to get
virtual machines information.

Maglica client worker is running on the same host which cli runs.
Client worker binds zeromq PUB socket to tcp://*:5555 and REP socket
to tcp://*:5556.

Client worker recieves requests from library through REP socket and throws
request to host workers through PUB socket.Also REP socket recives job results
from host workers.

Host workers are running on hosts which virtual machines are running on.

Host workers connect to the PUB socket of a client worker to receive job
requests and the REP socket of a client worker to throw job results.

= How to use Maglica =

You must setup libvirtd running on host machines and accessible through
tcp port. (See http://libvirt.org/remote.html)

Clone Maglica on a host machine and run the host worker.

 $ git clone git://github.com/mizzy/maglica.git
 $ cd maglic
 $ PYTHONPATH=. ./bin/maglica_host_worker --client=client.example.jp

Clone Maglica on a client machine.

 $ git clone git://github.com/mizzy/maglica.git
 $ cd maglica
 $ cp etc/maglica.conf.example etc/maglica.conf

 Edit etc/maglica.conf that points to host machines.

Run the client worker.

 $ PYTHONPATH=. ./bin/maglica_client_worker

Run maglica command to list up "original images"(which name is end with
the string "oroginal").

 $ PYTHONPATH=. ./bin/maglica image list
 Name                                     Host
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 SL6.0-x86_64.original                    host0.example.jp  
 SL6.1-x86_64.original                    host0.example.jp  
 SL6.0-x86_64.original                    host1.example.jp  
 SL6.1-x86_64.original                    host1.example.jp  

Run maclica command to clone a virtual machine image.

 $ maglica vm clone --image=SL6.1-x86_64.original --hostname=vm0.example.jp

This command clones the image and rewrites network setting of the image
with libguestfs.
